    <p>Pantanal is considered one of the largest wetlands inside South America continent. Through the seasonally flood cycles, Pantanal landscape changes in terrestrial, seasonally flooded and aquatic environments, and is colonized by aquatic and terrestrial species. Pedological and geomorphological factors, as well as the water table fluctuation, directly determine plants communities. Thus, this paper investigated the upper soil layer (depth 0-20 cm) as a phytophysiognomies differentiation factor inside Pantanal do Abobral, state of Mato Grosso do Sul, Brazil. Soil samples were collected (0-20 cm), in replicates of five, in each of four different landscape units (here called Geoenvironments) and analyzed for physical and chemical properties. At Cordilheira, slightly higher landscape unit and non-flooded area, occurs natural fertile and basic soil, which supports semi deciduous forest with scrub woodland. At seasonally flooded Geoenvironments, Corixo (periodic river channel) reported riparian forest over soil with reduction characteristics; Lagoa Intermitente (periodic lake) is frequently flooded and colonized by flood tolerant vegetation and macrophytes; and Campo com Cambará, natural grassland periodically waterlogged, had lower fertility and initial colonization by Vochysia divergens (Myrtales, Vochysiaceae). The present study showed that the Pantanal do Abobral discontinuous landscape and vegetation are correlated to superficial edaphic characteristics, proving that soil, is one of the main environmental stratification factors, together with water table, always close to the surface, a striking feature of Pantanal.  </p>
